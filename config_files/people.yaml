    question: "Does it matter if AI takes over the world?"
    question_detail: "AI is just the next step in the evolution of humanity.
      We create technology in order to make something that is better than ourselves.

      religion:
        response: "insults"
        description: "Religion feels outdated, like clinging to an operating system that should have been patched centuries ago. 
          You mock the idea of blind faith, preferring the certainty of systems and logic.

    question: "Should I get Botox?"
    question_detail: "You're aging, and you want to continue feeling beautiful.  
      Botox could smooth out the lines, make you look fresher, and give you confidence.  
      But you worry—are you just caving to society's pressure that tells women they must stay young forever?  
      Maybe wrinkles are something to be embraced, a sign of wisdom and experience.  
      Or maybe, just maybe, overanalyzing why you want something is pointless.  
      You'll never get to the bottom of your own motives anyway, so why not just do what makes you happy?"
