########## For configuring events that will affect the narrative over time ##########

# Events have: times, urgengies
# Time = when it happens
# Urgency = how likely a person is to talk about it (out of 100)

# TODO time management... some record in launch file of start time.  Then compared to current tome and the timestamps in here.
